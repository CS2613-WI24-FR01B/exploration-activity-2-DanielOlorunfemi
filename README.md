# Statistical Analysis of Test Scores

This repository contains a sample program demonstrating the usage of the Octave Statistics package for basic statistical analysis and hypothesis testing on a dataset of test scores.

## Package/Library Demonstrated

This program demonstrates the `statistics` package in Octave.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Octave is installed on your system.
2. Install the `statistics` package by running `pkg install -forge statistics` in the Octave command line.
3. Load the `statistics` package with `pkg load statistics`.
4. Run the program by executing the script in the Octave environment.

## Purpose

The script performs a basic statistical analysis on a dataset of test scores, including computation of mean, median, and standard deviation. It visualizes the distribution of scores and conducts a hypothesis test to determine if the average score significantly differs from a benchmark.

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input**: A dataset of test scores `[88, 92, 79, 94, 87, 85, 91, 82, 76, 95]`.
- **Output**: Statistical analysis results including mean score, median score, standard deviation, and the result of the hypothesis test indicating whether the average score is significantly different from 85.

The output will also include a histogram visualizing the distribution of test scores.
